# Close to tray for Inkdrop

This plugin shows a tray icon for Inkdrop and makes it possible to minimize Inkdrop to tray. Minimizing to tray can be
disabled in the plugin's settings. The tray icon can also be changed to a monochrome icon in the plugin's settings.

This plugin is similar to https://github.com/jmerle/inkdrop-tray but it also minimizes Inkdrop when you click the button to close the program.


Turned out it was impossible :(
